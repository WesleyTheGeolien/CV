\begin{entrylist}
  \entry
    {01/17 - 05/19}
    {Research Engineer}
    {\href{https://www.seequent.com/}{Seequent, Christchurch New Zealand}}
    {I pride myself on thinking laterally and outside of the box to provide novel innovative solutions, drawing on insights from both my geological and software engineering backgrounds.
    \\[3pt]
    The role permitted vast exposure to the company and clients. Regular client meetings and presentations were held as well as working, and leading, interdisciplinary initiative.
    \\[3pt]
    Seequent are the developpers of the \href{https://www.leapfrog3d.com/}{Leapfrog Suite}, a world standard for 3D implicit geological modelling software. Daily use and technical insights led me to become an expert user, continuously pushing the limits.
    \\[6pt]
   	\textbf{New Technologies} Some problems call for thinking outside the box and implementing new technologies from the base up. Examples of these projects included web based dashboard creation, integration of Jupyter into workflows and deploying compute intensive tasks to the cloud.
   	\\[6pt]
   	\textbf{New Solutions} Other projects included the reuse of core IP in novel manners. For example the automated creation of geological models from sub sets of data to sample geological uncertainty. This work was presented at Seequent's \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt26J5ljlA0}{Perth Lyceum}.
    \\[6pt]
   	\textbf{Core Strategy} Providing technical support for key business decisions including full verification of geostatistical implementations and creation of infrastructure to obtain and analyse usage metrics of Leapfrog software.

    {Software Integration Engineering Internship}
    {\href{https://www.total.com/en}{Total, Pau France}}
    {Discretization plays an important part in coupled Oil \& Gas basin modelling. Too fine, the computation time prevails, too coarse and the calculations do not converge. As a software integration engineer I implemented an interface with the \href{http://www.ring-team.org/software/ringmesh}{RINGMesh} library to dynamically re-mesh during simulations.\\ Reference : \href{mailto:tristan.cornu@total.com}{Tristan Cornu, Pore pressure and Rock Mechanics Specialist}}
