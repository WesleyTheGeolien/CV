  {Climate Simulations pose multiple technical problems from the setting up boundary of conditions to the interpretation of results.
  \\[3pt]
  As part of the paleo-climate team I lead the development of an \href{https://cerege-cl.github.io/netcdf_editor_app/}{open source interactive web based tool} to setup boundary conditions for the IPSL model. Relying on a micro-service architecture and messaging queues, complex compute is carried in multiple languages in different containers. The tool is used by the greater climate community for the ability to interactively edit NetCDF files.
  \\[3pt]
  Often simulation results are too large to manage on a local machine. I deployed and maintain the JupyterHub server for the group providing team members with a unified functional development environment and sufficient compute resources.
  \\[3pt]
  In a research environment outreach is crucial, to that end I designed and deployed the \href{https://cerege-cl.github.io/}{teams web portal.}}

   	\textbf{New Technologies} Some problems call for thinking outside the box and implementing new technologies from the base up. Examples of these projects included web based dashboard creation, integration of Jupyter into workflows and deploying compute intensive tasks to the cloud.

   	\textbf{New Solutions} Other projects included the reuse of core IP in novel manners. For example the automated creation of geological models from sub sets of data to sample geological uncertainty. This work was presented at Seequent's \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jt26J5ljlA0}{Perth Lyceum}.
